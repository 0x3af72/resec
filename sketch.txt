1. chat service (encrypted), backend will be hosted on pythonanywhere, frontend could be python or c++
 - encryption of message? look into some 2 way encryption algortihm like the one whatsapp uses
  -> how do i return the key? (SOLVED, ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION)
 - can join rooms with any username
 - could add text colouring optionally
 - how to send requests with c++? do i need c++ or can i just use python (use python)

each user has private key that is accessible to anyone, and rooms are just a medium to access other users
can have dms too...

TODO:
generic functions like showing all people in the group etc
migrate to czy6
now can work on frontend

DONE:
registering users (backend) (test)
NEW PROBLEM: RSA cant rencrypt large string, how fix? - can use another encryption method and encrypt the keys, or add message lerngth limit
OKY ABOVE ALMOST OK, BUT WEIRD NUMBER, CHECK IF ITS THE SAME ACROSS ALLO PLATFORM, CAN TRY ON REPLIT
how do groups work (backend)
sending messages (backend) - how does this work? groups... (TEST)
retrieving messages (backend) (test again now with messages)
joining gorups(backend) (TEST)
test sending messages in groups (backend)
test on pythonanywhere.com
logging out (test)
change groups shit to sets
leaivng group
upload to github
blocking people
unblocking people
testing blocking and unblocking

===========================
BIG NOTE: for verifying messages and retrieving messages, can use 2 step, first step generate secret code with public key, send to client, then
client decode it and return it back, if correct then passed, and reset the code (code must be very long, 2048 bits or something?), one wrong code and reset code and just return wrong code
ADDON: can periodically reset all codes, like every 5 min
OK DONE
===========================

backend:
 - server
 - keys
...

frontend:
 to be decided
